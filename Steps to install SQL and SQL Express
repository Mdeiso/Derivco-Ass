To install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and SQL Server Express. SQL Server Express is a free, lightweight version of Microsoft SQL Server, and SSMS is the graphical tool used to manage SQL Server instances. Here are the steps to install both:

Click the "Download" button to initiate the download.
Run the SQL Server Express Installer:

Once the download is complete, run the installer by double-clicking the downloaded file (usually an .exe file).
The SQL Server Installation Center will open.

Feature Selection:

Select the features you want to install. Ensure you select at least the "Database Engine Services" and "SQL Server Replication" features.

Launch SSMS:

After SSMS is installed, you can launch it from the Start menu or by searching for "SQL Server Management Studio."
